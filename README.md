# PEWLETT HACKARD ANALYSIS

## Project Overview
Planning for the large number of employees expected to retire over the next several years has begun. As part of the planning efforts, the purpose of this analysis is to identify the number of employees retiring by title and identify employees eligible for a new mentorship program. The analysis will help with succession planning for the upcoming "silver tsunami".

## Results

Over 72,000 employees are expected to retire in over the next several yers with the majority being senior level (Table 1).

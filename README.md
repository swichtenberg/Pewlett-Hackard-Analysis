# PEWLETT HACKARD ANALYSIS

## Project Overview
Planning for the large number of employees expected to retire over the next several years has begun. As part of the planning efforts, the purpose of this analysis is to identify the number of employees retiring by title and identify employees eligible for a new mentorship program. The analysis will help with succession planning for the upcoming "silver tsunami".

## Results

Over 72,000 employees are expected to retire in over the next several yers with the majority being senior level (Table 1). Conversely, only around 1,500 employees have the experience necessary to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees (Table 2).

Major points to consider include:
- 72,458 employees are expected to retire over the next several years.
- 70% of upcoming retirements are senior level (i.e. Senior Engineer, Senior Staff).
- 1,549 employees have the experience necessary to mentor other employees.
- 70% of potential mentors are senior level.

## Summary

As discussed above, a total of 72,458 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact with only 1,549 employees available to serve as mentors. Consequently, it is clear there are not enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. As the list of potential mentors was generated based on birth dates in a single year, it would be adviseable to expand the qualifications. Future queries could include expanding eligibility to a range of birth dates (e.g. 1960-1965), identifying mentors based on years of service, or identifying mentors based on current job title alone.
